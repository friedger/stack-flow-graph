# Stacks Transaction Visualizer

A web application for visualizing and analyzing Stacks blockchain transactions related to the SIP-031 endowment program. This tool provides interactive network graphs, transaction tables, and address balance tracking to help understand the flow of STX tokens through the network.

## About This Project

This site analyzes transaction data from CSV files exported from [fatstx.github.io](https://fatstx.github.io/). The analysis starts from the endowment address (currently `SM1Z6BP8PDKYKXTZXXSKXFEY6NQ7RAM7DAEAYR045`) defined in the SIP-031 contract and tracks the movement of STX tokens through the network.

### Features

- **Network Visualization**: Interactive graph showing relationships between addresses
- **Transaction Tracking**: Detailed transaction history with filtering and search
- **Balance Analytics**: Real-time balance tracking for all monitored addresses
- **Address Comments**: Tagged addresses for known protocols (Zest, Velar, etc.)
